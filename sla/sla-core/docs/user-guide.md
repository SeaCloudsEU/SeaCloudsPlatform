## <a name="rest">API Introduction</a> ##

The REST interface to the sla-core system has the following conventions:

* Every entity is created with a POST to the collection url. The body request contains the serialized entity in the 
  format specified in the content-type header. The location header of the response refers to the url of the new 
  allocated resource. The return code is a 201 on success. Templates and agreements have special considerations 
  (see the corresponding section). 
* A query for an individual item is a GET to the url of the resource (collection url + external id). The format of the 
  response is specified in the http header with the accept parameter. The return code is 200. As expected, a not found
  resource returns a 404.
* Any other query is usually a GET to the collection's url, using the GET parameters as the query parameters. The 
  result is a list of entities that match the parameters, despite the actual number of entities. The return code is 
  200, even if the list is empty.
* Any unexpected error processing the request returns a 5xx.
* An entity (or list) is serialized in the response body by default with the format specified in the Content-type 
  header (if specified). The request may have an Accept header, that will be used if the resource allows more than one 
  Content-type.
* Updating an entity involves a PUT request, with the corresponding resource serialized in the body in the format 
  specified in the content-type header. The return code is 200.
* If a query has begin and/or end parameters, the following search is done: `begin <= entity date < end`

## <a name="operations">Generic operations</a> ##

The generic operations of resources are shown below. 
Each particular resource (in following sections) show the supported operations, and any deviation from the behavior 
of generic operations. 

The format of a resource can be modified by a project by using serializers.

## <a name="enforcement-jobs">Enforcement Jobs</a> ##
An enforcement job is the entity which starts the enforcement of the agreement guarantee terms. An agreement can be 
enforced only if an enforcement job, linked with it, has been previously created and started. An enforcement job
is automatically created when an agreement is created, so there is no need to create one to start an enforcement.

* Enforcement jobs collection URI: /enforcements
* Enforcement job URI: /enforcements/{AgreementId}

An enforcement job is serialized in XML as:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
	<enforcement_job>
		<agreement_id>agreement02</agreement_id>
		<enabled>true</enabled>
		<last_executed>2014-08-13T10:01:01CEST</last_executed>
	</enforcement_job>

An enforcement job is serialized in JSON as:

	{"enabled":true,
	 "agreement_id":"agreement02",
	 "last_executed":"2014-08-13T10:01:01CEST"}

###GET /enforcements/{AgreementId}###
