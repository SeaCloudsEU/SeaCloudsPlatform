/**
 * A GuaranteeTerm in ws-agreement is defined as:
 * <pre>{@code
 * <wsag:GuaranteeTerm Name="xs:string" Obligated="wsag:ServiceRoleType">
 *   <wsag:ServiceScope ServiceName="xs:string">xs:any?</wsag:ServiceScope>*
 *   <wsag:QualifyingCondition>xs:any</wsag:QualifyingCondition>?
 *   <wsag:ServiceLevelObjective>
 *     <wsag:KPITarget>
 *       <wsag:KPIName>xs:string</wsag:KPIName>
 *       <wsag:CustomServiceLevel>xs:any</wsag:CustomServiceLevel>
 *     </wsag:KPITarget>
 *   </wsag:ServiceLevelObjective>
 * </wsag:GuaranteeTerm>
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * The GT is "interpreted" in the core as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Name: is a name to identify the term between all the terms.
 * <li>Obligated: it is always considered as "Provider", despite the attribute value.
 * <li>ServiceScope: the scope where the term takes into account. The serviceName refers 
 *   to a serviceName defined in the agreement. The text, if set, describe the element/service term
 *   this guarantee term applies to. <b>It is a restriction of the core to have one ServiceScope per
 *   GT as much</b>.
 * <li>QualifyingCondition. When this GT is going to be enforced. This is provider domain value.
 * <li>KPIName: The name of a kpi
 * <li>CustomServiceLevel: the constraint that the KPI has to fulfill
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Valid constraints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>current-response-time < desired-response-time
 * <li>current-response-time < 100
 * </ul>
 * 
 * In these constraints, current-response-time" and "desired-response-time" are service 
 * properties (wsag:ServiceProperties/Variable). The changing value is considered to be retrieved from
 * a external monitoring module. The location of the static value (wsag:Variable/Location) is considered 
 * to be the place where it is defined in the ServiceDescriptionTerms. 
 * 
 * The constraints are given a name with the KPIName. In the constraints above, a possible KPIName could be 
 * "response-time".
 * 
 * <b>It is a restriction of the core that there can be only one "changing variable" per ServiceLevelObjective</b>.
