        <a href="http://www.seaclouds-project.eu">SeaClouds (Seamless adaptive multi-cloud management of service-based
        applications)</a> is an EU-funded research project, which focuses on the problem  of deploying and managing complex
        multi-component applications over heterogeneous clouds in an ecient and adaptive way.

        SeaClouds allows developers to design, deploy, manage and configure complex applications across multiple and
        heterogeneous clouds, something unfeasible hitherto.

        <h2><small>What is SeaClouds?</small></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>SeaClouds is a software platform which makes more ecient the design,
                development, planning and management of complex business applications
                distributed on multi-cloud environments.</li>
            <li>SeaClouds provides an enterprise capability with continuous software delivery
                that enables independent application vendors to mitigate risks and reduce
                time and cost to market and customer feedback.</li>
            <li>SeaClouds orchestrates services, platforms and infrastructures to ensure they
                directly and dynamically, meet the needs of cloud applications.</li>
        </ul>
